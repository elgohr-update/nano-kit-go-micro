// Package chbuf implmenets Channel Buffering Patterns.

//
// Message buffering is one kind of transformation that is sometimes useful in these systems.
// Some programs donâ€™t need to process each message immediately, and can more efficiently
// process several messages at once. Other programs receive bursty input but are able to
// coalesce groups of messages.
